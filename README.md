# animal-crossing-project
This is a statistical analysis project on the 'stalk market' in the game Animal Crossing: New Horizons.
## Project Description
This project aims to identify the best day and time to resell purchased turnips. I will analyze factors such as the day of the week, time of day, weather, and buying patterns.
## Files
- 'Animal Crossing Project.xlsx': File containing the data that I collected over four weeks.
## Data Collection
Data was collected over four weeks, twice a day, tracking the following variables:
- **Date**: The date of the price check. There are two entries for each day.
- **Time of Day**: The resell price of the turnips changes twice daily - morning and afternoon.
- **Turnip Price**: The resell price of the turnip for each given time.
- **Weather**: The type of weather during each price check (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy).
- **Buying Pattern**: Whether or not the turnips were bought in bulk. For this project, bulk is considered three bunches of turnips, and not bulk is considered one bunch of turnips.
## Analysis
### Time of Day
### Weather Conditions
### Buying Patterns
## Usage
## Future Improvements
While collecting my data, I noticed a few areas of my research that were flawed. Here are some things that I would change if I decided to do this project again:
- **Time of Day Issues**: In my project, I have the time of day listed as either morning or afternoon since the turnip prices change at noon. This causes issues if the time of day recording the price is not consistent because the weather may not be the same the entire morning or afternoon. In the future, I would change the Time of Day variable to a certain time in the morning and a certain time in the evening.
